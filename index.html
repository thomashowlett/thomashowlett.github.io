			<p style="text-align:justify">(Above) Myself and a fellow student who made the HSC honour roll. <br> (Photo taken from the Newcastle Herald Published 14th Dec. 2017) <br><br> (Dec. 2017) After the anxious wait for the announcement of our Atar's, on the morning of results, i was surprised to be greeted by the voice of the Assistant Principle and Dean of Students of the school. She pleasantly greeted me and commended me on my efforts as i had ranked 5th in the state for Industrial Technology and informed me that the local Herald were waiting to interview and take my picture at the school that day. I ended up recieving a mark of 98 for the Industrial technology subject. </p>

     		<font size="24" color="orange">Industrial Technology: Multimedia Major Work <center><img src="CTRL.png" width=800></center> </font> </p>
			<p style="text-align:justify">(Aug. 2017) 'CTRL///'was my first real project and was undertaken in the Year 12 HSC Industrial Technology course requiring the submission of a major work, accompanying folio and seperate video evidencing the construction of the project. In the division of Industrial Technology: Multimedia, I chose to engage with my audience on the topic of internet security through the medium of a short film/music video, combining a wide range of visual effects and animation elements. Follow this <a href="https://29092737.github.io/">link</a> to view the 4 minute long video, accompanying 40 page A3 Folio, 'Behind the Scenes' video and Hand coded website submitted by myself to the NSW Education Standards Authority (NESA) for marking. <br> Whilst not my first work showcasing learnt video editing, cinematography and animation 'skills', I believe this was my first real attempt at the creative world and the multitude of awards and nominations that were as a result of the project really opened up my eyes to                            an unforeseen career path I now wanted to pursue.</p>

			<p style="text-align:justify">(July. 2017) Now showing much more interest in the subject and in between working on a nine-month long major project, i was fortunate enough to have been allowed to attend 7 days work experience at perhaps Newcastle's most infamous Creative Agency; Headjam. The few members of the team at Headjam each specialised in their own area of skills and i was able to pickup a few tips from the studio's Web Designer, Graphic Designer, Broadcast Designer and Account Manager each demonstrating what it is like to be employed by an Ad. Agency.  </p>

			<p style="text-align:justify">(Above) Recieving an award for my top rank in Industrial Technology and being recognised for volunteering the production of an interview style video to promote Religion across schools. <br><br> (2017) After the school began to recognise my talent in the field of Multimedia, the Student Coordinators (teachers) approached me multiple times throughout the year asking for assistance in editing short videos for the school. This included an 'infomercial' style video and six poster images for one of the school's colour house days, an interview style video which promoted the subject Studies of Religion to new students and their parents and assisting students new to video editing in subjects which required their own production of a video, just to name a few.  </p>

			<p style="text-align:justify">(Dec. 2016) After completion of the Preliminary (Year 11) Industrial Technology course, I submitted my individual assignment task consisting of and titled; 'Weather Report' to the Annual Wollongong State STEM Awards. Not expecting any repercussions, myself and one other student in the class were called to attend the awards evening to recieve awards for our projects. I ended up claiming the title of 'Multimedia Technologies Focus Area Award Winning Student' and $150 prize money which i put towards purchasing my first DSLR camera.  </p>

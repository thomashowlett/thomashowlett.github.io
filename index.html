			<p style="text-align:justify">(Above) Myself and a fellow student who made the HSC honour roll. <br> (Photo taken from the Newcastle Herald Published 14th Dec. 2017) <br><br> (Dec. 2017) After the anxious wait for the announcement of our Atar's, on the morning of results, i was surprised to be greeted by the voice of the Assistant Principle and Dean of Students of the school. Expecting a phone call about doing something against the school's rules (Usually what was thought if the school were to ever call), i was pleasantly greeted and told i had ranked 5th in the state for the Industrial Technology subject and that the local Herald were waiting to interview and take my picture that day. Thank god for that acheivement because it covered up the rest of my Atar, as far as people were concerned, i was the guy who came 5th in the state, no other questions were asked! </p>

			<p style="text-align:justify">(Aug. 2017) 'CTRL///'was my first real project and was undertaken in the Year 12 HSC Industrial Technology course requiring the submission of a major work, accompanying folio and seperate video evidencing the construction of the project. In the division of Industrial Technology: Multimedia, I chose to engage with my audience on the topic of internet security through the medium of a short film/music video, combining a wide range of visual effects and animation elements. Follow this <a href="https://29092737.github.io/">link</a> to view the 4 minute long video, accompanying 40 page A3 Folio, 'Behind the Scenes' video and Hand coded website submitted by myself to the NSW Education Standards Authority (NESA) for marking. <br> Whilst not my first work showcasing learnt video editing, cinematography and animation 'skills', I believe this was my first real attempt at the creative world and the multitude of awards and nominations that were as a result of the project really opened up my eyes to                            an unforeseen career path I now wanted to pursue.</p>

			<p style="text-align:justify">(Dec. 2016) After completion of the Preliminary (Year 11) Industrial Technology course, I submitted the individual assignment consisting of and titled; 'Weather Report' to the Annual Wollongong State STEM Awards. Not expecting any repercussions, myself and one other student in the class were called to attend the awards evening to recieve awards for our projects. I ended up claiming the title of 'Multimedia Technologies Focus Area Award Winning Student' and $150 prize money which i put towards buying my first DSLR camera. Having taken the course as an extra, this was my first realisation that this was in fact a subject I appeared somewhat good at and I continued to enrol in the course into my senior year to debunk if this award was netted from pure luck.  </p>
